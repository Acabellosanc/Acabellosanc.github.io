    <p id="p3"> Jordan Terrell Carter (born September 13, 1996), professionally known as Playboi Carti, is an American recording artist from Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
    <p id="p4"> After months of garnering buzz and momentum off of his successful debut mixtape, Carti released his debut studio album Die Lit on May 11, 2018. The album included popular tracks “Love Hurts,” “Shoota,” and “Poke It Out.” Die Lit is a reminder of the power of simplicity, as the album is full of effortless vibes and hypnotic flows that create an array of catchy, uncomplicated tracks. On certain tracks, notably “FlatBed Freestyle,” Carti explores different vocal inflections and emphasizes his Atlanta accent in his delivery more.
</p>
<p> Carti has also been on the journey with Thou, crossing the wilderness in order to become an immortal duo!!!</p>
